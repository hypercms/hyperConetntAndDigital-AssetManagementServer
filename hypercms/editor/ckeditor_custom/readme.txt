When CKEditor will be updated, the following changes need to be done:
1. Load the custom CKEditor config of hyperCMS (will be done by default)
2. Load Plugins hcms_linkbrowsebuttons and hcms_video in custom hyperCMS config (will be done by default)
3. Overwrite the files of CKEditor Plugin image (ckeditor/plugins/image) with the files of hcms_image (ckeditor_custom/hcms_image)
